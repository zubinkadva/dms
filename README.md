# Document Management System (DMS)

My final year MCA internship project developed (not entirely by me) for dMACQ Software Private Ltd.

It uses PHP as front end interface and MySQL for back end storage.

This repository does not contain any code, simply documentation stuff; but nevertheless, since I have done work, it is part of my github repositories.
